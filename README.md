# Cost of Brexit

We need to understand how much Brexit costs.

I propose to create a web app which aggregates the following information:

- Job creation cancelled as a result of Brexit (eg Virgin)
- Jobs moved offshore as a result of Brexit (eg JP Morgan)
- Government budgets cut as a result of Brexit  (eg Cornwall)
- Research/Arts funding cut as a result of Brexit
- _etc_

Some of these cuts are to come. Some are already with us. We should be able to
see what's on the horizon as well as what's happening already.

Of course, any positive news should also be included. 

It will become more and more difficult to say what's caused by Brexit and what's 
not, of course. But still: this is worth trying.

## How to get involved

As well as programming skills, we will need to collect relevant news and
research.

The technology will be Ruby on Rails.
